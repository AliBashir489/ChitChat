ChitChat is an advanced messaging application developed utilizing SwiftUI for the user interface and Firebase, Firebase Authentication, as well as other Firebase services for backend services. This application supports user account management, real-time messaging, and comprehensive user profile management. It incorporates key functionalities such as user authentication, profile customization, message persistence, time tracking, user search capabilities, and real-time communication.

Features:

User Authentication: Implements Firebase Authentication to facilitate secure user login and account creation.

Profile Management: Utilizes Firebase Firestore to enable users to configure and update their profile images.

Real-Time Messaging: Employs Firebase Realtime Database to support instantaneous message exchange.

User Search: Allows users to query and locate other users by email address, facilitating the initiation of new conversations.




Multithreading and Concurrency Management:

Background Processing: Employs concurrent background threads for operations such as retrieving user information from Firestore and managing image uploads to Firebase Storage, thus avoiding main thread congestion and ensuring smooth application performance.

Asynchronous Real-Time Updates: Utilizes asynchronous techniques to handle real-time data synchronization and message retrieval, optimizing user interaction responsiveness.

Dispatch Queues: Leverages GCD (Grand Central Dispatch) to allocate tasks to appropriate dispatch queues, thereby ensuring seamless UI performance and preventing potential UI thread blocking.
